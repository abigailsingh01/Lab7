A makefile is a file containing a set of directives used by a make build automation tool to generate a target/goal.

`make` make reads makefile present in current directory and executes based on statements in makefile

`make clean` should be run at the end of the session to clear out temporary files.

`echo`  is a command that outputs the strings it is being passed as arguments.
